# Winter Arc: 90 Days of Python + AI/ML

### By Anurag Chandra  

This is my personal 90-day challenge to sharpen Python, dive into AI/ML, and share the journey daily.  
The idea is simple: stay consistent, build things that actually work, and document the process openly.

90 Days of Python & AI Mastery — One Post a Day  

Goals:  
- Strengthen Python fundamentals.  
- Build practical AI/ML projects.  
- Share daily insights, mistakes, and progress on LinkedIn.  
- End the 90 days with a portfolio and confidence in my skills.

## Daily Progress Log

I’ll use this section to track progress, day by day. Each entry will have the date, what I worked on, and the link to my LinkedIn post for that day.  

### First 10 day
- **Day 1 (01 - Oct - 2025):** 


*(I’ll extend this week by week until Day 90.)*

## End Goals
- 6–7 portfolio-ready projects  
- 90 posts on LinkedIn (one each day)  
- Strong foundation in Python and ML basics  
- A deployed project to showcase

## Why This Challenge?
I am an ECE student at NIT Patna, and I want to go beyond classroom learning by applying what I know.  
This challenge is not just about writing code. It’s about discipline, building real things, and creating a visible track record of growth.
