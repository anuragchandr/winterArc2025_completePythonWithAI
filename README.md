# Winter Arc: 120 Days of Python + AI/ML ❄️

## By **Anurag Chandra**

This is my personal 120-day challenge to sharpen Python, dive into AI/ML, and share the journey daily.
The idea is simple: stay consistent, build projects that actually work, and document the process openly.

## The 120-Day Practical Pace Plan

This roadmap is designed around a simple, effective loop: **Learn a concept -> Practice it in isolation -> Apply it to a project.**

### Phase 1: Python Mastery (Days 1-30)

**Goal:** Build unshakeable confidence in Python by focusing on one core concept at a time and immediately applying it.

- **Week 1 (Days 1-7): Foundations & Functions**

    - **Focus:** Solidify basics and master functions.
    * **Action:** Spend a few days on advanced functions (`*args`, `**kwargs`, recursion). Dedicate a full day just to recursion exercises.
    * **Project:** Apply this knowledge to build the **To-Do List CLI**.

- **Week 2 (Days 8-14): The World of OOP**
    * **Focus:** Give Object-Oriented Programming the time it deserves.
    * **Action:** Spend two days on theory (Classes, Objects) *on paper* before coding. Then, spend the rest of the week translating that into code.
    * **Project:** Start the **Blackjack Game**. Begin by just building the `Card` and `Deck` classes.

* **Week 3 (Days 15-21): Advanced OOP & Robust Code**
    * **Focus:** Inheritance and making your programs professional.
    * **Action:** Introduce Inheritance and apply it to the `Player` and `Dealer` classes in your game. Dedicate two full days to learning `try-except` error handling.
    * **Project:** Refactor your To-Do app to handle user errors gracefully.

* **Week 4 (Days 22-30): File I/O, APIs & Review**
    * **Focus:** Making your programs persistent and connected.
    * **Action:** Learn to save data to `.txt` and `.json` files. Learn to fetch data from the web using the `requests` library.
    * **Project:** Finish and polish the Blackjack game. The last three days are for **review and refactoring only**. No new topics.

### Phase 2: The Data Science Toolkit (Days 31-60)
**Goal:** Get comfortable manipulating and visualizing data—the bedrock of all AI/ML.

* **Week 5 (Days 31-37): NumPy**
    * **Focus:** Master the fundamental package for numerical computing.
    * **Action:** This entire week is **just for NumPy**. Start with array creation and move to indexing, broadcasting, and mathematical operations. Work through exercises, not a large project.

* **Week 6 (Days 38-44): Pandas**
    * **Focus:** Learn the most important library for data analysis.
    * **Action:** Spend the week on `DataFrame` and `Series`. Learn how to select, filter, group, and clean data.
    * **Project:** On the last day, find a simple CSV dataset online (like world cities or movie ratings) and practice the week's skills.

* **Week 7 (Days 45-51): Visualization**
    * **Focus:** Learn to tell stories with data.
    * **Action:** Spend the week with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. Learn to make bar charts, line plots, histograms, and scatter plots.
    * **Project:** Use the dataset from last week and create a variety of insightful visualizations.

* **Week 8 (Days 52-60): First Data Project & Review**
    * **Focus:** Consolidate all your data skills.
    * **Action:** The first four days are dedicated to your first real data project.
    * **Project:** Complete the **Nobel Prize Data Analysis** from start to finish: cleaning, manipulating, and visualizing. The rest of the week is for **review and exploring** another dataset of your choice.

### Phase 3: Applied Machine Learning (Days 61-90)
**Goal:** Understand the core concepts of ML and build your first predictive models from scratch.

* **Week 9 (Days 61-67): Intro to ML & Regression**
    * **Focus:** Grasp the core vocabulary and your first algorithm.
    * **Action:** Spend three days on theory: Supervised vs. Unsupervised learning, train-test split, and the Scikit-Learn library.
    * **Project:** Spend the rest of the week understanding and building a **Linear Regression** model for the **Salary Predictor** project.

* **Week 10 (Days 68-74): Classification**
    * **Focus:** Learn how to predict categories.
    * **Action:** Spend a few days learning the theory behind **Logistic Regression** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.
    * **Project:** Build a **Classification Model** for a dataset like the famous Iris flowers or a simple spam detector.

* **Week 11 (Days 75-81): Model Evaluation & Improvement**
    * **Focus:** Learn how to know if your model is actually good.
    * **Action:** This week is dedicated to theory. Learn about **Confusion Matrices, Accuracy, Precision, and Recall**. Learn the basics of **Feature Engineering**. No new projects, just apply these concepts to your previous models.

* **Week 12 (Days 82-90): Capstone & Wrap-up**
    * **Focus:** Solidify your learning and prepare your portfolio.
    * **Action:** Learn one more advanced algorithm, like **Random Forest**.
    * **Project:** The entire last week is for a **Final Capstone Project**. You can choose to expand one of your previous projects (like the House Price Predictor) or start a new one. The final day is for writing a blog post or a detailed summary of your 90-day journey.

### Phase 4: Deep Dive and Expansion (Days 91-120)
**Goal:** Explore advanced topics, expand your skillset, and refine your portfolio.

* **Week 13 (Days 91-97): Advanced Machine Learning Models**
    * **Focus:** Explore more complex algorithms and ensemble methods.
    * **Action:** Learn about **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** and **Gradient Boosting**.
    * **Project:** Implement these models on previous datasets and compare their performance.

* **Week 14 (Days 98-104): Neural Networks with TensorFlow/Keras**
    * **Focus:** Introduction to deep learning.
    * **Action:** Learn the basics of neural networks, layers, and activation functions. Get hands-on with TensorFlow or Keras.
    * **Project:** Build a simple neural network for image classification (e.g., MNIST dataset).

* **Week 15 (Days 105-111): Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
    * **Focus:** Learn to process and analyze text data.
    * **Action:** Study text preprocessing techniques, sentiment analysis, and basic NLP models.
    * **Project:** Build a sentiment analysis model for movie reviews or Twitter data.

* **Week 16 (Days 112-120): Portfolio Refinement and Advanced Projects**
    * **Focus:** Polish your existing projects and explore more challenging problems.
    * **Action:** Refactor code, improve documentation, and deploy one of your projects.
    * **Project:** Tackle a more complex project that combines multiple skills, such as a recommendation system or a chatbot. Dedicate time to writing detailed documentation and a comprehensive final report.

## Why This Challenge?
I am an ECE student at NIT Patna, and I want to go beyond classroom learning by applying what I know.
This challenge is not just about writing code. It’s about discipline, building real things, and creating a visible track record of growth.
