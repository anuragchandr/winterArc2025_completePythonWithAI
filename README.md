# Winter Arc: 120 Days of Python + AI/ML ❄️

## By **Anurag Chandra**

This is my personal 120-day challenge to sharpen Python, dive into AI/ML, and share the journey daily.
The idea is simple: stay consistent, build projects that actually work, and document the process openly.

## The 120-Day Practical Pace Plan

This roadmap is designed around a simple, effective loop: **Learn a concept -> Practice it in isolation -> Apply it to a project.**

### **Phase 1: Python Mastery (Days 1-30)**

**Goal:** Build unshakeable confidence in Python by focusing on one core concept at a time and immediately applying it.

- **Week 1 (Days 1-7): Foundations & Functions**

    - **Focus:** Solidify basics and master functions.
    * **Action:** Spend a few days on advanced functions (`*args`, `**kwargs`, recursion). Dedicate a full day just to recursion exercises.
    * **Project:** Apply this knowledge to build the **To-Do List CLI**.

- **Week 2 (Days 8-14): The World of OOP**
    * **Focus:** Give Object-Oriented Programming the time it deserves.
    * **Action:** Spend two days on theory (Classes, Objects) *on paper* before coding. Then, spend the rest of the week translating that into code.
    * **Project:** Start the **Blackjack Game**. Begin by just building the `Card` and `Deck` classes.

* **Week 3 (Days 15-21): Advanced OOP & Robust Code**
    * **Focus:** Inheritance and making your programs professional.
    * **Action:** Introduce Inheritance and apply it to the `Player` and `Dealer` classes in your game. Dedicate two full days to learning `try-except` error handling.
    * **Project:** Refactor your To-Do app to handle user errors gracefully.

* **Week 4 (Days 22-30): File I/O, APIs & Review**
    * **Focus:** Making your programs persistent and connected.
    * **Action:** Learn to save data to `.txt` and `.json` files. Learn to fetch data from the web using the `requests` library.
    * **Project:** Finish and polish the Blackjack game. The last three days are for **review and refactoring only**. No new topics.

### __Phase 2: The Data Science Toolkit (Days 31-60)__
**Goal:** Get comfortable manipulating and visualizing data—the bedrock of all AI/ML.

* **Week 5 (Days 31-37): NumPy**
    * **Focus:** Master the fundamental package for numerical computing.
    * **Action:** This entire week is **just for NumPy**. Start with array creation and move to indexing, broadcasting, and mathematical operations. Work through exercises, not a large project.

* **Week 6 (Days 38-44): Pandas**
    * **Focus:** Learn the most important library for data analysis.
    * **Action:** Spend the week on `DataFrame` and `Series`. Learn how to select, filter, group, and clean data.
    * **Project:** On the last day, find a simple CSV dataset online (like world cities or movie ratings) and practice the week's skills.

* **Week 7 (Days 45-51): Visualization**
    * **Focus:** Learn to tell stories with data.
    * **Action:** Spend the week with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. Learn to make bar charts, line plots, histograms, and scatter plots.
    * **Project:** Use the dataset from last week and create a variety of insightful visualizations.

* **Week 8 (Days 52-60): Statistical Foundations & Inference**
    * **Focus:** Core statistical concepts for data analysis and ML — visualization, summary statistics, probability, and hypothesis testing.
    * **Action:** Short theory + hands-on code examples each day (use a notebook). Apply tests to a small dataset on the last day.
    * **Project:** Mini analysis notebook on Day 60: compute summaries, visualize distributions, run a hypothesis test, and summarise findings.

## **Phase 3: Applied Machine Learning (Days 61–90)**

**Goal:** Build solid ML foundations, understand multiple algorithms, learn model tuning, explore unsupervised learning, apply SQL for data work, and finish with an NLP project.

---

### **Week 9 (Days 61–67): ML Foundations, EDA, Data Prep & First Projects**

**Focus:** Understand the complete ML pipeline end-to-end before touching advanced algorithms.
**Action:**

* Start with: What is ML, types of ML, real applications, traditional programming vs ML, AI vs ML vs DL
* Learn the full ML workflow: EDA → Cleaning → Preprocessing → Feature Engineering → Feature Selection
* Build two introductory ML projects from scratch following the video.

**Project:** Recreate **Project 1** and **Project 2** with full pipeline, documentation, and evaluation.

---

### **Week 10 (Days 68–74): Regression Deep Dive & Optimization**

**Focus:** Master Linear Regression beyond the “Scikit-Learn shortcut.”
**Action:**

* Learn: Regression theory, cost function, gradient descent, convergence theorem, hyperplanes
* Implement regression manually and with Scikit-Learn
* Understand overfitting/underfitting with real examples

**Project:** Two Regression Projects — one simple, one with more complex preprocessing — analyzing model behavior deeply.

---

### **Week 11 (Days 75–81): Classification — Multiple Algorithms + Full Project**

**Focus:** Learn how ML models classify data and compare multiple algorithms.
**Action:**

* Learn: Logistic Regression, Log Loss, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, SVM
* Implement each algorithm from scratch (as per video)
* Learn evaluation techniques (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 etc.) through hands-on examples

**Project:** Build a **multi-model classification pipeline**, compare all algorithms, and integrate a simple frontend view (as done in the video).

---

### **Week 12 (Days 82–90): Model Tuning, Ensembles, Unsupervised ML, SQL & NLP Capstone**

**Focus:** Move from basic ML to practical, production-ready techniques.
**Action:**

* Learn tuning techniques: Cross-validation, Grid Search CV, Random Search CV
* Study and implement ensemble methods: Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, XGBoost
* Explore unsupervised learning: K-Means, DBSCAN, PCA
* Master SQL fundamentals for ML workflows: CRUD, Joins, Constraints, Views, Procedures
* Finish with a full NLP workflow

**Project:**

* **Final Capstone 1:** SQL mini-exercises + relational querying
* **Final Capstone 2:** NLP Emotion Detection Project using preprocessing → TF-IDF → ML model → evaluation.
* Final day: Document your 30-day journey and prepare a polished project portfolio.

## Why This Challenge?
I am an ECE student at NIT Patna, and I want to go beyond classroom learning by applying what I know.
This challenge is not just about writing code. It’s about discipline, building real things, and creating a visible track record of growth.
